#Adventure 2
#Going N-E
'''The adeventurers awaken to find the city the Ukriah more populated than normal
(provided a knoweledge check). When they pass the long houses they find that the 
nothern clans (head druids) are meeting to dicsusses the detection of a magical 
force eminating from the moutains. Only Agewyn (possibly radovan with successful 
DC= 14) will be let inot the meeting [ the rest are outsiders].
   >>>In the meeting
   THe head druids discuss the unsettled mountains and diffculty communing with 
   the mountains. The mountain, Wynloc, has felt particularly agitated about the 
   presence. (This mountain, is gaurded by the FeuerNacht clan). They generally 
   support sending a Horde to the moutnain to destroy whatever is creating the 
   magic.
   
   Ulitmatley, it is decided that they will send a small cast of barabarians and 
   loyal members of the clabn to ensure that the land is safe from demons before the 
   head druids go to destory the magic. 

After the meeting, assume they will talk. But make it very apparent that the clans
will not allow them to approach the mountians. Anyone seen heading to or found on 
mountain will be killed on sight. 

In the mean time they can do side quests to get some extra training before fighting 
any elementals
